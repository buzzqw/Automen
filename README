This repository contains code of my applications

you will find the code for AutoMen, AutoFFmpeg, MultiX264.

The applications are quite similar
AutoFFmpeg: aim to use only ffmpeg as encoder
MultiX264: is a multi decoder/encoder but always for X264
AutoMen: is a multi encoder gui (mencoder , x264 , ffmpeg) able to encode with xvid/mpeg4,x264,wmv codec

All source code is under GLP3 and developed with purebasic (now 4.6beta4). 
all code aims to be portable with linux
